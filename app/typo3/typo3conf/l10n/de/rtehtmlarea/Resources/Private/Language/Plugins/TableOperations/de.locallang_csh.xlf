				<source>In Firefox, when a set of contiguous table cells have been selected with a mouse movement or through the keyboard, clicking the "Merge cells" button merges the selected cells into a single cell.

In other browsers, when the cursor is positioned in a cell, clicking the "Merge cells" button prompts the user for the number of rows to the right and the number of columns down over which the cells should be merged. The set of contiguous cells so defined are then merged.</source>
